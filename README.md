# FraudTagger Apple Mail Integration

This repository contains all you need to allows Apple Mail to automatically check incoming emails using the FraudTagger API and flag potential spam/machine generated email addresses in the sender field.

## Components

- `fraud_check.sh`: A shell script that queries the FraudTagger API.
- `fraudtagger.scpt`: An AppleScript that integrates the shell script with Apple Mail.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy `fraud_check.sh` to `~/bin/` and make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/bin/fraud_check.sh
   ```

2. Edit the script and insert your API key.

3. Copy `fraudtagger.scpt` to `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/`

4. Edit the Applescript and insert your username in the line	- do shell script "/Users/YOURUSERNAME/bin/fraud_check.sh " & quoted form of senderEmail.
   
5. In Apple Mail:
   - Create a rule that runs the script for every message.
   - The rule will flag emails if the classification is "SPAM".
  
## API Key Usage

### Paid Access (With API Key)
The script by default uses a paid API key for access. You can set your own API key in the script by modifying the `API_KEY` variable:

```bash
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### Free Tier Access (Without API Key)
You can test FraudTagger for free by commenting out the `API_KEY` variable:

```bash
#API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
The API will allow a small number of checks per day (see latest website information or API response limits data for exact details)



## Notes

- The script logs API responses to `~/fraudtagger_log.txt`.
- Customize the AppleScript to move flagged messages to "Junk" if desired.



## ðŸ“„ Example API Response

This is a typical JSON response returned by the `fraud_check.sh` script and logged to `~/fraudtagger_log.txt`:
